title: "Implementing the Heston Option Pricing Model in Object-Oriented Cython"
author:
- name: Brandon C. Hardin 
  affiliation: Utah State University
abstract: "The 1973 Black-Scholes model, a revolutionary option pricing formula whose price is "relatively close" to observed prices, makes an asumption that the volatility is constant and thus, deterministic. This causes some inefficiencies and patterns in the pricing of options due to the model providing evidence of the "volitility smile" of the implied volatility. Many scholars have suggested that the volatility should be modelled by a stochastic process and the (1993) Heston Model is one of many proposed solutions to remedy this problem. The Heston Model allows for the "smile" by defining the volatitliy as a stochastic process. This thesis considers a solution to this problem by utilizing Heston's stochastic volitility model in conjunction with Euler's discretization scheme in a simple Monte Carlo engine. The application of this model has been implemented in object-oriented Cython, for it provides the simplicity of Python, all the while, providing C-like performance."
